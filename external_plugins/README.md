# External Plugins
This folder is intended to be the path to install modules and drivers for other data types.
Usually the projects here have their own git repository and development road and are independent from the general development of *Biospytial*

Currently the modules installed are:

* (DjangoFIA)[https://github.com/molgor/DjangoFIA] : A data model for the *Forest Inventory Analysis program*(FIA)[https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/]
* (spystats)[https://github.com/molgor/spystats]: A simple geostatistical modelling tool box written in Python.
* (biospytial_rwrapper)[https://github.com/molgor/biospytial_rwrapper] A wrapper to use Biospytial in R.
