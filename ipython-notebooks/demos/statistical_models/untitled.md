# Model-based geostatistics in the Tree of Life

This is a text that describes the different ways to extract information based on the Tree of Life.

We will follow a Bayesian Approach by nesting a Gaussian Process as an intensity function. 

Suppose for the moment that we have the following model.

$$y = $$

```python
print("Oke oke")
print(2+2)
a = 3
```
a = 3
a is {{a}}
